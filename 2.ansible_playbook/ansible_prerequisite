Assuming server is on AWS, add a rule to security group to allow access to only your public IP to ssh?

For this we need to have installed boto3 in centos or ubuntu machine. Please install boto3 and excute this ansible yml provided or else you can 
create an seperate yml for this below code.

command:

ansible-playbook <ansible yml file>

=================================================
 - name: Security group change in AWS instance
      ec2_group:
         name: ssh_security_group
         description: an example EC2 security group
         vpc_id: <vpc-..> #vpc id
         region: eu-west-1
         aws_secret_key: <secret key> # aws secret key
         aws_access_key: <access key> # aws access key
         rules:
           - proto: tcp
             from_port: 10022
             to_port: 10022
             cidr_ip: <source machine ip> # mention the source ip that you want to add as rule in ingress  security group of the instance
